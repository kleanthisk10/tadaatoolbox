# tadaatoolbox 0.8.1 (on GitHub)

* Fix typo in `DESCRIPTION`, misspelling `pixiedust`. Sorry!
* Bump dependencies
    - `pixiedust` depends on R (>= 3.2.1), so we might as well depend on that version, too
    - Specifiy minimal versions for `pixiedust`, `sjmisc`, `broom`, and `ggplot2`, just to be safe
* Add vignette
    - Overhauling `README` to be less redundant compared to the usage vignette

# tadaatoolbox 0.8.0 (on CRAN)

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Working on CRAN compatibility
* Submitted to CRAN
* It's on CRAN, yay!
